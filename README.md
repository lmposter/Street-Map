### Introducing Simple Street Map (SSM): Your Lightweight Terminal-Based Navigation Assistant

**Overview**

Simple Street Map (SSM) is an innovative, terminal-based application designed to simplify navigation through concise street maps. Built with the complexities of urban navigation in mind, SSM distills the essential features needed for efficient vehicular movement across an area. By leveraging a simplified version of the rich, user-generated data from OpenStreetMap (OSM), SSM provides a streamlined mapping solution that is both easy to use and highly effective for planning routes.

**Key Features**

- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Designed to run smoothly on terminal interfaces, SSM is an ideal solution for users seeking a straightforward, resource-friendly mapping tool.
- **Simplified Map Elements**: Focuses on the core elements of navigation—nodes and ways—to deliver clear, uncluttered map views.
- **Dynamic Pathfinding**: Offers real-time calculations of travel times and route suggestions, taking into account one-way streets and speed limits to optimize your journey.
- **Interactive Shell Interface**: Engage with SSM through a simple, command-line interface that supports various commands for map exploration and route planning.
- **Educationally Inspired**: Born out of a programming assignment, SSM is a testament to the practical application of C programming skills, including structures, arrays, and dynamic memory allocation.

**Explore with Ease**

Navigating through SSM is intuitive. Start by loading your desired map file, and immediately dive into exploring nodes (points on the map) and ways (road segments). Whether you're looking for a specific street or need to find the best route between two points, SSM's commands are designed to provide quick and accurate responses. With support for finding paths based on travel time and creating paths from start to end points, planning your journey has never been easier.

**For Developers and Enthusiasts**

SSM is not just a tool for end-users; it's also a fantastic resource for developers and programming enthusiasts looking to understand the intricacies of map-based applications. With its open design and emphasis on C programming principles, SSM serves as a valuable learning platform for anyone interested in data structures, algorithm design, and software development best practices.

**Get Started**

To begin using Simple Street Map, ensure you have a terminal environment set up. Follow the straightforward setup process to compile the application, and then load one of the provided map files or one of your own. With a few simple commands, you'll be navigating your way through cities and regions with ease.
